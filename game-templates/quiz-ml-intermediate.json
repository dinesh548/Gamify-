    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the purpose of cross-validation?",
      "options": [
        "To increase training data",
        "To evaluate model performance on unseen data",
        "To reduce overfitting",
        "Both B and C"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Both B and C",
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "Cross-validation helps evaluate performance and reduce overfitting by testing on different data splits."
    },

      "id": "q2",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which algorithm is best suited for non-linear classification?",
      "options": ["Linear Regression", "Logistic Regression", "Decision Tree", "K-Means"],
      "correctAnswer": "Decision Tree",
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "Decision trees can handle non-linear relationships through hierarchical decision boundaries."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on test data.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "points": 2,
      "explanation": "Yes, overfitting means the model memorized training data but doesn't generalize well."
    },

      "id": "q4",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does 'bias-variance tradeoff' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "Balancing model complexity",
        "Choosing between algorithms",
        "Data preprocessing",
        "Feature selection"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Balancing model complexity",
      "points": 4,
      "explanation": "The tradeoff between underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance) by adjusting model complexity."
    },

      "id": "q5",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which metric is best for imbalanced classification problems?",

      "correctAnswer": "Both B and C",
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "Accuracy can be misleading with imbalanced data. Precision and F1-Score provide better insights."
