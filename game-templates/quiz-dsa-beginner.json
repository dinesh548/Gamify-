    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the time complexity of accessing an element in an array by index?",
      "options": ["O(1)", "O(n)", "O(log n)", "O(n²)"],
      "correctAnswer": "O(1)",
      "points": 2,
      "explanation": "Array access by index is O(1) because arrays use direct memory addressing."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which data structure follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle?",
      "options": ["Queue", "Stack", "Array", "Linked List"],
      "correctAnswer": "Stack",
      "points": 2,
      "explanation": "Stack follows LIFO - the last element added is the first one removed."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the main advantage of a linked list over an array?",
      "options": ["Faster access", "Dynamic size", "Less memory", "Better cache performance"],
      "correctAnswer": "Dynamic size",
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically, while arrays have fixed size."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "A doubly linked list allows traversal in both directions.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "points": 2,
      "explanation": "Yes, doubly linked lists have pointers to both next and previous nodes."
    },

      "id": "q5",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the time complexity of inserting at the beginning of a linked list?",
      "options": ["O(1)", "O(n)", "O(log n)", "O(n²)"],
      "correctAnswer": "O(1)",
      "points": 3,
      "explanation": "Insertion at the head of a linked list is O(1) - just update the head pointer."
